The most pressing problems of our time are the relationships among the different classes of our modern community
and the relationships between our community and the nature. Comprehending ecosystems' ecology can help us address
a wide range of issues in a viriety of aspects, both scientific and societal.<br />

In 2016, I completed my BSc in Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

It was then when I realised the great part that Bioinformatics play in every aspect of modern biology;
in ecosystem functioning as well. <br /><br />


During my master, I joined <a href="http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/"> lab42open </a> at <a href="http://imbbc3.hcmr.gr/">IMBBC-HCMR</a>.

I became a member of the group in 2017 and since then I have developed <a href="https://github.com/hariszaf/pema">PEMA </a>,
a pipeline for the analysis of metabarcoding data. PEMA has been
selected from <a href="https://www.lifewatch.eu/">LifeWatch - ERIC</a> for
the analysis of the ARMS derived data.

Further, in the framework of the <a href="http://prego.hcmr.gr/">PREGO project</a>,
I am now conducting my PhD entitled: “Merging NGS data, knowledge aggregation and data  integration techniques,
along with ecological network analysis (ENA): an attempt to decipher  microbial community
ecology and ecosystem functioning by taking advantage of the hypothesis-generating method”. <br /><br />

My research interests focus on microbial ecology and ecosystem functioning at the microbial
dimension via systems biology approaches.

In this website you may find my so-far research work as well as some issues that have caught my attention.

<p>

Biology has been my passion since always.

In 2016, I completed my BSc in Biology at the National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens.

Afte that I had my MSc in Bioinformatics at the University of Crete (2018). Bioinformatics
play a great role in every level of modern biology; in ecosystem functioning as well.

I am a member of <a href="http://lab42open.hcmr.gr/"> lab42open </a> at IMBBC-HCMR since 2017.
In the framework of  <a href="http://prego.hcmr.gr/">PREGO project</a>, I am now conducting my
PhD entitled: “Merging NGS data, knowledge aggregation and data  integration techniques,
along with ecological network analysis (ENA): an attempt to decipher  microbial community
ecology and ecosystem functioning by taking advantage of the hypothesis-generating method”.

My research interests focus on microbial ecology and ecosystem functioning at the microbial
dimension via systems biology approaches.

I have developed PEMA, a pipeline for the analysis of metabarcoding data, which has been
selected from LifeWatch - ERIC as the one for the  analysis of the ARMS derived data.
